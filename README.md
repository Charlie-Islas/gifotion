About the project 

Gifs can be really fun to see, especially when it comes to gifs that show people's emotions in spontaneous ways. However, the gifs are spread all over the Internet and sometimes it takes a while until you get to see some that you really like. This is how I had the idea that it would be really fun to have a gif browser where all you had to do was press a button and it'd collect all the fun gifs for you. 

So I created a page that does exactly that. It gives you a predetermined list of 12 emotion buttons and everytime you click one of them, the page automatically displays 15 gifs that you can animate and pause by clicking on them. In addition, there is an input field that lets you add furhter emotions that are not included in the previous list. It is a very fun page to look at and have a good laugh. Enjoy and, if you have any doubt or question, feel free to contact me!
